1.Modules in eXpOS are used to perform certain logical tasks, which are performed frequently.
2.These modules run in kernel mode and are invoked only from the kernel mode. A user program can never invoke a module directly. Modules can be invoked from interrupt routines, other modules or the OS startup code.
3.As modules execute in kernel mode, the kernel stack of the currently scheduled process is used as the caller-stack for module invocation.

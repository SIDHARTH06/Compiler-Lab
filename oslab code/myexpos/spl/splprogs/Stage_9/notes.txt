::::::::::::::::::Stage 9:::::::::::::::::::::::::
1.eXpOS requires that when the OS enters an interrupt handler that runs in kernel mode, the interrupt handler must switch to a different stack.

2.To isolate the kernel from the user stack, the OS kernel must maintain two stacks for a program - a user stack and a kernel stack

3.The kernel stack is used to store the execution context of the user process. (The backup and restore instructions of the XSM machine facilitate this).

4.The kernel maintains a data structure called System Status Table where the PID of the currently executing user process is maintained.

5.The System Status Table is stored starting from memory address 29560.

6.Registers R0-R15 are user registers.

7.Registers R16-R19 are marked for kernel use and hence the kernel can modify them. The SPL compiler will use these registers to translate your SPL code.


Note: If you try to execute init program of stage 10 in this stage it will give an null instruction because  INT 7 is not defined in this stage.
